# PingPong

## Goal

The goal of this exercise is to connect Nodes together, send some messages
across them, and see what happens when those messages fail.

## Additional exercises

* Reset monitors when we detect a down signal
* Try spawning a few thousand consumers all monitoring a single producer. What
happens when you disconnect the node now?
